# Keyboard Configuration for Durgod Taurus K320 using Karabiner


## Simple Modifications
These modifications make the keyboard layout (control, command, option) similar to that on Mac keyboards:

* application -> right_option
* right_option -> right_command

## Complex Modifications
These modifications make the navigation keys, and shortcuts to take screenshots, just like on Ubuntu Linux:

* shift+print_screen to command+shift+4
* print_screen to command+shift+3
* Change caps_lock to command+control+shift
* PC-Style Control+Delete
* PC-Style Copy/Paste/Cut
* End key to the end of the line (Control + e)
* Home key to the beginning of the line (Control + a)
* Swap left_command with left_option
